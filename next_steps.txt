- use TextBox instead of BlockLabels?
- overhaul Tutorial text (add new Highlighting, add Tutorials, ...)
+ show a popup with a description when you collect a Collectible
+ fix description in Shop
+ ColorRules: more than 1 rule per line
+ adapt Fight navigation
    + stay in "Adapt" until you leave (use trick from Shop?)
    + check how hard it would be to manually decide the Qubits to operate on
+ add Boss
+ implement scripted Tutorial
- add Training-Table to SpawnRoom (implement with flee rate)
+ fix focus on screen switch
+ overhaul explore screen layout
- adapt StateVector visualization?
+ add RiddleRoom
+ add GateRoom
+ add ShopRoom
- create Rooms from file
+ create bigger Map

? ChallengeRooms: only use 3 gates, only 1 Hadamard, only 3 adaptions, ...


1) Richtung Levels gehen
2) Tipps, Hintergründe mittels Textfelder (für "Unwissende")
3) Aufhübschen





+ test outside of the game how hard it would be to reach simple 0/1 state-sequences (e.g. 'q0 = 0, q1 = 0, q2 = 1')
+ adapt Enemy to the test findings (e.g. use
    a real StateVector
        +shows better functionality
        -explodes
        -harder to understand initially
        -harder to implement enemies with less qubits than you use
    a cbit-list
        +shows real world better since we need to measure
        +more scalable
        +easier to auto-generate
        +allows more qubits
        -less possibilities
        -hard to show the StateVector of the enemy in a meaningful way
    multi-shots with probabilities for the qubits
        +more possibilities
        +shows real world usage
        +a bit more scalable,
        -how to show StateVector?
    //+-> a StateVector is stored and the multi-shot probabilities will be compared
+ create Enemy target at the beginning of the fight
    - create a pool of possible targets beforehand and pull it at the beginning of the fight
+ add Fight screen
+ add Rooms as part of the Map
+ make Fight-actions independent from game and player_widget (they should only retrieve them for "executing"/visualization)


SMALL TWEAKS/FIXES:
- remove self.__player from game.py
